# To-be-or-Not-to-be

#The goal of this project was to use the native features and features gained through my own feature engineering of the Shakespeare dataset to predict the speaker of each line from each Shakespeare play in the dataset. 

#Originally, I was going to include a couple of engineered features, such as line length and the inclusion of the player identities in each scene, in order to obtain a good degree of accuracy. However, the native features of the dataset already had a good amount of information that needed only slight processing. 

#In the end, I was unfortunately not able to finish the training of my decision tree model, as there were data entry errors that I was not able to solve. If the decision tree method had gone well, then I would have included an attempt with a random forest model.
